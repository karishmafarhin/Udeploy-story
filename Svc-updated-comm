All application teams who are using their own service accounts for DevOps tool integrations or automations (e.g., Bitbucket, Nexus, Jenkins, etc.) are requested to follow the below guideline:

Guidelines:

Create and use separate service accounts per tool or automation â€“ do not reuse the same account across multiple tools or processes.

Ensure all service accounts are properly documented and owned by your team.

Review your existing setups and update them wherever required.


ðŸ‘‰ If your team is not currently using any service accounts, you may ignore this message. However, this guideline will apply if your team decides to use service accounts in the future.

This will help maintain stability, traceability, and ensure smooth functioning of DevOps tools and automations.

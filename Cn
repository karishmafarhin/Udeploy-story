uDeploy Upgrade:
We still have agents running on version 7.0.5 in both uDeploy DEV (400+) and PROD (1000+) environments. IBM has confirmed that this version is no longer supported. The version we plan to upgrade to is 7.13.2, but to reach that, we must first upgrade to 7.2.3. This process requires coordination with the respective application teams to upgrade the agents accordingly. We are currently analyzing the best approach to perform this upgrade in phases.

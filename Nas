Subject: Recommendation for NAS Volume Size for UDeploy Archive Data

Dear [Client's Name],

We have analyzed the current storage consumption of the archive directory on the uDeploy server, which holds archived data. The following details summarize the findings:

Current Storage Usage: 6.4 TB (1 year of data).

Retention Requirement: Minimum of 3 years of data.

Estimated Storage Requirement for 3 Years: Approximately 19.2 TB.


To ensure sufficient storage capacity and accommodate future growth or unexpected increases, we recommend creating a dedicated NAS volume of 22â€“25 TB for the archive data. This allocation will provide room for expansion while meeting the 3-year retention requirement.

Please let us know your thoughts or if any further details are required.

Best regards,

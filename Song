Hi Team,

We would like to clarify that we have not created any users manually in SonarQube. All users are onboarded exclusively through Okta SSO, as SAML integration has been in place for many months.

In our current configuration:

Users authenticate only via Okta SSO

The SAML User Login Attribute in SonarQube is set to userName

The Okta/SAML team has confirmed that Okta is sending the expected userName attribute, and that the alphanumeric login value is not coming from Okta


Despite this, SonarQube is generating internal alphanumeric login values for some new users.

We need your help to understand:

1. Why SonarQube is assigning an internal alphanumeric login even when the user is logging in through Okta SSO with the correct SAML attributes.


2. What conditions cause SonarQube to ignore the SAML-provided login attribute and instead generate a unique internal ID.


3. What configuration or logs we should check to identify the exact reason behind this behavior.



This issue is not related to manual user creation on our side, and we request your guidance in identifying the root cause within SonarQube.







Thanks for your response.

First, I would like to clarify that I did understand your earlier comment — but our situation does not match what you’re calling “default behaviour.”

No users were ever created manually from our side.

For many months, all SSO users were getting their SSO ID as the login in SonarQube.

Only recently, some new SSO users started getting an internal alphanumeric login instead.


So if this is truly the default behaviour, then our question is:

Why did this not happen earlier, and why is it happening only for some new users now?

Additional point regarding SIAM integration

We are currently working on integrating SIAM for access provisioning.
The SIAM team uses the SonarQube login value in API calls to assign users to groups.

Earlier → login was always SSO ID → API calls worked fine

Now → login is alphanumeric for some users → API logic breaks


So we need guidance on the following:

1. Can this “default behaviour” be overridden so that SonarQube always uses the SSO username as the login?


2. Which attribute from SAML should we rely on for API calls to consistently identify the user’s SSO ID?


3. If SonarQube insists on generating internal logins, how do we reliably map them back to the user’s SSO ID for API operations?

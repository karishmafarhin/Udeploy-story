As part of our access control improvements in uDeploy, we have created a restricted_access team and removed all privileges to prevent direct deployments to Prod.

During our review, we identified a few resources where both Dev and Prod agents are mapped under the same resource. This setup is causing access restrictions intended for Prod to also affect Dev deployments.

To address this, we plan to create separate resources for Dev agents in these identified cases. This will ensure smooth Dev deployments while maintaining proper access control for Prod environments.

Kindly review and provide your sign-off to proceed with this activity.

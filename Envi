Sure! Here's a short version:

Environment in uDeploy

An Environment is a deployment target like Dev, QA, or Prod. It defines where an application will be deployed and includes:

Mapped Resources (e.g., servers or containers)

Environment-specific Properties (e.g., credentials, hostnames)

Approval Gates and Access Controls

Tracks deployed component versions


Think of it as a stage where your application is deployed and tested.



Great question!

What is an Environment in UrbanCode Deploy (uDeploy)?

An Environment in uDeploy is a logical representation of a deployment target — like Dev, QA, UAT, Staging, or Production. It defines where your application will be deployed.


---

You Can Think of an Environment As...

> A “deployment stage” with specific configurations and infrastructure mapped to it.




---

Key Features of an Environment:

1. Deployment Target

It represents actual infrastructure (e.g., servers, containers) through resources and agents.


2. Component Mapping

You map components of your application to resources in the environment, which tells uDeploy where and how to deploy each part.


3. Environment Properties

Each environment can have its own properties like:

Hostnames

Credentials

Ports

Environment-specific flags



4. Approval Gates & Access Control

You can enforce rules like:

Manual approvals for Production

Limited access to critical environments



5. Version Tracking

uDeploy tracks which version of each component was deployed in a specific environment.

Real-World Analogy

Think of your application as a play, and environments are different theaters:

The script (application process) is the same.

The actors (components) are the same.

But each theater (environment) has different seating, lighting, and audience — requiring slight adjustments.

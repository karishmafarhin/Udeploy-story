Environment in uDeploy

An Environment is a deployment target like Dev, QA, or Prod. It defines where an application will be deployed and includes:

Mapped Resources (e.g., servers or containers)

Environment-specific Properties (e.g., credentials, hostnames)

Approval Gates and Access Controls

Tracks deployed component versions


Think of it as a stage where your application is deployed and tested.

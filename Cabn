Hereâ€™s the improved version of your text in better English:

"We have created a NAS volume to migrate uDeploy archive data from SAN to NAS, with a recovery capacity of approximately 7TB. The data migration has been completed, and we will configure the NAS path in uDeploy PROD tomorrow. After monitoring for a couple of weeks, we will proceed with deleting the archive directory from the server."

Let me know if you need any further refinements!

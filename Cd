Since NAS sync is enabled between the CloudBees CD Production and Disaster Recovery (DR) servers, all production configurations are automatically synchronized with the DR environment. As a result, when the DR environment is brought online, it will reflect the production configuration, including the connections to production agents. This leads to a session ID conflict, impacting production deployments, as the same production agents are linked to both the Production and DR environments.

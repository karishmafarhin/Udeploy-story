Hereâ€™s a properly drafted version of your note:

Drafted Version:

The plugin configuration is not supporting Bearer Token authentication after OKTA integration.
We tested all four available authentication types on that day; however, all methods except Bearer Token were working during the "Test Connection" step. In actual deployment, Bearer Token authentication fails.

Additionally, Bearer Token is not working in curl either.
Basic authentication is consistently returning a 500 error code in test scenarios, but it works correctly when executed via direct curl commands and through the plugin configuration (with the auth token set as the password).

Therefore, we have decided to continue using Basic Authentication since it is working successfully during deployments.

Would you also like a slightly more formal version depending on where you need to send this (email, ticket update, documentation)?
I can give you options!

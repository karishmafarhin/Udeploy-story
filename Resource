Resource in UrbanCode Deploy (uDeploy)

A Resource is a logical representation of a deployment target — like a server, directory, or cluster — where components are deployed.


---

Key Points:

Maps to Agents: Resources are linked to agents that physically execute deployment tasks.

Organized Hierarchically: You can create a tree of resources (e.g., server → directory → component).

Used in Environments: Environments use resources to know where to deploy each component.

Supports Grouping: You can create resource groups for batch deployments or HA setups.



---

Think of a resource as the “address” where uDeploy sends your app to be deployed — while the agent is the worker at that address.

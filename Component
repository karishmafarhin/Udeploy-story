In UrbanCode Deploy (uDeploy), a component represents a deployable unit of an application. It is the fundamental building block used to model what is being deployed.

What a Component Is:

A component can be:

A Java .jar, .war, or .ear file

A script or configuration file

A set of Docker images

Any versioned artifact that needs to be deployed



---

Key Aspects of Components:

1. Versions

Each time you import or build new content for a component, it creates a new version.

You can track, promote, and roll back versions easily.


2. Component Processes

Define how to deploy the component (e.g., copy files, restart service, run scripts).

Reusable across different environments.


3. Source Configuration

Components can fetch versions from:

Jenkins

Nexus/Artifactory

File system

Git

UrbanCode Build

Or any custom source via plugins



4. Integration

Linked to applications, which coordinate the deployment of multiple components together.

Mapped to resources/agents to define where it gets deployed.

Example:

If you're deploying a Java web app:

You might have one component for the WAR file

Another for config files

Another for DB migration scripts

Let me know if you want a visual or example setup.

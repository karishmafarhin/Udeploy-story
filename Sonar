Subject: SonarQube Upgrade to Version 2025.1 LTA â€“ Introduction of New Rules & Quality Gates

As part of our ongoing platform enhancement initiatives, we are upgrading SonarQube to version 2025.1 LTA.

The DEV environment is now live with the latest Quality Gates and Rules introduced in this version.

The PROD environment will be upgraded to version 2025.1 LTA on Saturday, but will continue to use the existing rules and quality gates to avoid any immediate impact.


We request all Application Teams to thoroughly validate their projects in the SonarQube DEV environment using the new rules and quality gates. This validation phase will span 6 months, providing sufficient time for teams to assess the impact of these changes and address any issues before they are promoted to production.

After successful completion of the 6-month validation period, we will enable the new rules and quality gates in the PROD environment, ensuring a smooth and controlled rollout with minimal disruption.

For any queries, please reach out to @DevOps Support.

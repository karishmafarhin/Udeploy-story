We (Bitbucket support team) are raising this case on behalf of an application team that is using the Automation Anywhere (RPA) tool to push code changes to Bitbucket using a Non-Personal Account (NPA).

This setup was working fine until September 2024. After that, the push operation started failing with the below error:

git push dry run failed, user doesn't have push access on the git repo

Observations & Troubleshooting Done:

The NPA account has Write permissions on the repository.

We also tried granting Admin privileges, but the same error persists.

Authentication is working fine — the NPA can successfully log in to Bitbucket from the RPA tool, and we can see “active a moment ago” status during the authentication attempt.

The failure occurs only during the git push operation from Automation Anywhere.

No configuration changes have been made on Bitbucket during this period.


Request for Assistance:
Please help us identify the root cause and confirm if there have been any changes or updates in Bitbucket authentication or Git push behavior post-September 2024 that could be impacting integrations with Automation Anywhere or similar RPA tools.

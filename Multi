A multi-uDeploy agent setup is implemented to enhance high availability (HA) and scalability for deployment tasks. Here's a brief explanation:

Why it was needed:

1. High Availability (HA):

Ensures that deployment processes are not interrupted if one agent goes down, as another agent is available to take over the workload.



2. Scalability:

Distributes deployment tasks across multiple agents, reducing the risk of bottlenecks during large-scale or concurrent deployments.



3. Load Balancing:

Balances deployment workloads, especially in environments like PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry), where multiple applications or services might be deployed simultaneously.



4. Fault Tolerance:

Minimizes the impact of agent failure, reducing downtime and ensuring continuous delivery pipelines remain operational.




What it actually does:

Multiple agents are configured under the same logical setup.

When a deployment request is initiated, uDeploy automatically selects an available agent.

If an agent becomes unavailable, other agents take over the pending deployment tasks without manual intervention.

This setup supports environments with high deployment demands or critical applications requiring 24/7 uptime.

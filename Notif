Dear Project Teams,

We hope this message finds you well. Recently, we reached out regarding the cleanup of inactive repositories in Bitbucket, particularly those with no commits in over two years.

After further discussion, it has been decided that the management of inactive repositories will remain with the respective project teams. As repository owners, you are best positioned to assess their relevance and determine whether to retain, archive, or delete them.

We kindly request you to review your repositories and take the necessary actions to maintain an organized and efficient workspace.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and understanding. If you have any questions or require support, feel free to reach out.

Perfect ‚Äî here's a revised explanation including that important detail about the difference between normal and dynamic worker nodes:


---

üîç Background of the Issue:

Our Java application is failing in dynamic Kubernetes worker nodes with the error:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: libfreetype.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This happens because Java requires the native libfreetype.so.6 library for font rendering via libfontmanager.so.

On normal (static) worker nodes, this issue doesn't occur because the library is already available at the OS level.

However, in dynamic worker nodes (spun up on demand during pipeline execution), the environment is clean and minimal ‚Äî so the required library is missing from the container, causing the application to crash at runtime.


---

‚úÖ Solution:

Option 1: Add the missing libfreetype package to the Docker image used by the application.

Option 2: If the app doesn't rely on font rendering or GUI, run Java in headless mode:

java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar your-app.jar

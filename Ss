1. SSL Certificate Import
No manual SSL certificate import is required on the Java we installed.
This Java was uploaded under Managed Java Packages, and uDeploy handles SSL communication through the server-side certificate configuration. No action is required in DEV or PROD.

2. Java Installation Path
The Java installed via the uDeploy UI cannot be placed under /appbin/install.
Once added as a Managed Java Package, uDeploy controls the installation path internally and uses that managed location for agent compatibility and future upgrades. Custom installation paths are not supported.

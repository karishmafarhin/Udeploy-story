Dear Team,

As part of the upcoming uDeploy version upgrade, it is mandatory to upgrade the uDeploy agents installed on your Dev and Prod application servers. This upgrade is a prerequisite and must be completed by all application teams to ensure compatibility and uninterrupted deployments after the platform upgrade.

Action Required from Application Teams:

1. Upgrade the uDeploy agent on your respective servers from version 7.0.5 to 7.2.3 by following the step-by-step guide documented here: [Confluence Page Link].


2. Complete the upgrade no later than [Insert Deadline, e.g., 15-Oct-2025].


3. Validate the agent post-upgrade to confirm it is functioning correctly.



Note:

Teams that do not upgrade their agents by the deadline may experience deployment failures after the uDeploy version upgrade.

Please refer to the attached agent list which specifies all servers that require the upgrade.


For any issues or support during the agent upgrade, please contact the DevOps/Platform team.

Your timely cooperation is essential for the success of this upgrade.

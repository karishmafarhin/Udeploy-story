Dear Team,

Following our joint troubleshooting session with the vendor and your team, hereâ€™s a summary of our findings and next steps:

1. QA Repository Issue:
The issue with the QA repository is not related to Bitbucket. It appears to be caused by an application-side problem within Automation Anywhere. We request your team to check this further with your Automation Anywhere vendor.


2. Sandbox Repository:
The connectivity issue in the sandbox environment was due to SSL certificate validation. Once the SSL verification was disabled (sslVerify=false in Git), the connection to Bitbucket was successful, and code push to the test branch worked as expected.


3. Branching & Repository Standards:
We observed that your team is pushing changes directly to the master branch, which is not a recommended practice. Master branch is now protected with restrictions as per our standard governance policy.

We request you to follow the standard branch permissions and repository template recommended by the Bitbucket team.

If there is a specific business requirement to be exempted from these restrictions, please obtain SVP-level approval along with a clear business justification and share it with us for review.



Please review the above and proceed accordingly. Let us know once the QA-side investigation with your vendor is complete or if you need any further support from our side.
